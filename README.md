# HCNNDA: Hierarchical Consensus Network for ncRNA–Drug Association Prediction
**Abstract**:Numerous studies indicate that Non-coding RNA–drug interactions critically influence disease regulation and treatment outcomes; therefore, accurately predicting these associations is vital for novel drug discovery and individualized therapy. Current ncRNA–drug association predictors find it challenging to simultaneously leverage deep complementarity across multiple views and cross-entity interactions; their dependence on mere linear weighting or single-layer fusion often neglects information hierarchies, resulting in limited model discriminative capability. In response, we introduce the Hierarchical Consensus Network (HCN), which comprises three sequential consensus stages: initially, a multi-head self-attention mechanism at the view layer dynamically fuses diverse similarity features; Subsequently, a Transformer coupled with contrastive learning at the entity layer ensures consistent representation within each entity; Lastly, global interaction consensus is constructed via cross-entity cross-attention, and a gating module aggregates multi-layestruggle to simultaneously leverage deep complementarity across multiple views and cross-entity interactions; their reliance on linear weighting or single-layer fusion often overlooksr representations efficiently, with a lightweight MLP producing the final association probability. We validated HCN on multiple publicly available datasets using cross-validation, achieving notable improvements in both AUC and AUPR compared to conventional approaches. Subsequent experiments further confirmed the model’s superior accuracy and robustness.
